Welcome
-------

The :mod:`cpp-netlib` is a library that provides application layer
protocol support using modern C++ techniques.  It is light-weight,
fast, cross-platform and is intended to be as easy to configure as
possible.

It is developed by people linked to the Boost_ community and will at
some point in the future be submitted for review into Boost.  A
presentation about :mod:`cpp-netlib` was given at `BoostCon 2010`_,
for which the `slides`_ and the `paper`_ can be found on-line.

Sneak Peek
----------

The :mod:`cpp-netlib` allows you to write semantically consistent code for
making different kinds of higher level network applications.

The library allows for writing simple code for simple C++ HTTP client
applications:

.. code-block:: c++

    using namespace boost::network;
    using namespace boost::network::http;

    client::request request_("http://www.boost.org/");
    request_ << header("Connection", "close");
    client client_;
    client::response response_ = client_.get(request);
    std::string body = body(response_);

The library also allows for writing simple C++ HTTP servers:

.. code-block:: c++

    namespace http = boost::network::http;

    struct handler;
    typedef http::server<handler> http_server;

    struct handler {
        void operator() (http_server::request const & request_,
                         http_server::response & response_) {
            response = http_server::response::stock_reply(
                http_server::response::ok, "Hello, world!");
        }

        void log(http_server::string_type const & info) {
            std::cerr << "ERROR: " << info << '\n';
        }

    };

    int main(int arg, char * argv[]) {
        handler handler_;
        http_server server_("0.0.0.0", "8000", handler_);
        server_.run();
    }

The :mod:`cpp-netlib` is being developed for eventual submission to Boost_.
