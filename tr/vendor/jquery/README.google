Description:
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things
like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and
Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of
browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has
changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
