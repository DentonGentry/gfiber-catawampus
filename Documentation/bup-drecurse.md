# NAME

bup-drecurse - recursively list files in your filesystem

# SYNOPSIS

bup drecurse [-x] [-q] [--exclude *path*]
[--exclude-from *filename*] [--profile] \<path\>

# DESCRIPTION

`bup drecurse` traverses files in the filesystem in a way
similar to `find`(1).  In most cases, you should use
`find`(1) instead.

This program is useful mainly for testing the file
traversal algorithm used in `bup-index`(1).

Note that filenames are returned in reverse alphabetical
order, as in `bup-index`(1).  This is important because you
can't generate the hash of a parent directory until you
have generated the hashes of all its children.  When
listing files in reverse order, the parent directory will
come after its children, making this easy.

# OPTIONS

-x, --xdev, --one-file-system
:   don't cross filesystem boundaries.

-q, --quiet
:   don't print filenames as they are encountered.  Useful
    when testing performance of the traversal algorithms.

--exclude=*path*
:   a path to exclude from the backup (can be used more
    than once)

--exclude-from=*filename*
:   a file that contains exclude paths (can be used more
    than once)
    
--profile
:   print profiling information upon completion.  Useful
    when testing performance of the traversal algorithms.
